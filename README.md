This dataset was built within the ANR project TIME US. It is maintained by Alix Chagu√© (@alix-tz). The original documents are copyright-free, so are the digitization and the transcription. However, digitizing archives and properly annotating a corpus takes time and it is a task that should be recognized. If you use any item from this corpus of ground truth, cite the dataset using the following information:
